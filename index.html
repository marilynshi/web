  <h2> What is a ccc? </h2>
  

  <p> A chocolate chip cookie is a type of cookie that has a plain cookie base with chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient.  </p>

 <h2>Attributes of the perfect ccc</h2>


  <p>In my opinion, the perfect chocolate chip cookie is crispy in the edges, chewy in the middle, and soft in the center, with metled chocolate (preferably dark chocolate) throughout.</p>

 <h2> Best chocolate to use </h2>


 <p>I like dark chocolate to balance out the sweetness of the cookie base, but the real trick is to use chocolate chunks rather than chocolate chips. Not only does it took more delicious, it gives the cookies puddles of molten chocolate lava</p>
 <p>Here's a demo video on cutting your own chocolate chunks: </p>
